    <h4>
    <p>There  are important aspects related to hiring or associating with someone.
    Two of those are: diversity and out of the box thinking and behaving.</p>
    <p>I do not fit a pattern when it comes to the ususal listing of work background.<p>
    I have given myself to different areas of experience rather than the usual job idea.</p>
    <p> My projects took a lot of courage and hard work.</p>
    <p>In that matter, I could highlight my projects of studyig different languages by myself.</p>
    <p>Concerning Italian, I have reached a point where I successfully produced
      Portuguese subtitles for Italian fiction by listening to the material.</p>
  <p>That stated, I can jotdown that I have worked as a private English teacher.
  I had about 20 student in 20 years. This does not translate into one per year
  since I hsd no student in the periods that I llived abroad.</p>
  <p>My job as an English teacher at public school lasted for about one year. And it was essencial
  for understanding that I do not have the gift for teaching for groups.</p>
  <p>My project of being an entrepeneur in Italy is in the process. And it is going to use
  the abilities acquired studying English from the age of 10,
 the writing workshops I have taken,  the Italian language I have acquired and continue
to learn, my recent study of web design.</p>
<p>The course I've taken on Patisserie and Boulangerie is also something that I will
use for one of my projects but this is towards pre-retirement.</p>
<p>As it can be infered,  dedicated more time to studying than mst people. And that path
left me with a certain gap when it comes to working for someone else.
But I have definetely worked on myself and I am sure to harvest, in due season,
fruits above the average.</p>
